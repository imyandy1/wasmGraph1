A simple experiment with Go WASM on the HTML5 Canvas (2D), showing
working keyboard input.

Use the wasd, arrow, or numpad keys to move the square around.

Note - Much of this came from https://github.com/stdiopt/gowasm-experiments,
then simplified (removing mouse input) + keyboard event handler added.
